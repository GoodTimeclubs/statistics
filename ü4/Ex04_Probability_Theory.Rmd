# Exercise 4.2.4: Weak LLN

**Exercise text:**\
Let $X_i \sim \mathrm{Uniform}[0,1]$ i.i.d. Prove with pen and paper that\
$$
\bar X_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \xrightarrow{P} \frac12.
$$ Simulate\
$$
P(|\bar X_n - 1/2| > 0.05)
$$ for various $n$ and confirm the Weak LLN empirically.

```         
```

# Bonus: Chebyshev Inequality Comparison

**Exercise text:**\
Using Chebyshev’s inequality, bound\
$$
P(|\bar X_n - 1/2|\ge 0.05)
$$ for $X_i \sim \mathrm{Uniform}[0,1]$. Compare your bound to the empirical values in Exercise 1.

# Exercise 4.4.4: CLT Approximation

**Exercise text:**\
Let $Y_i \sim \mathrm{Exp}(3)$. Approximate\
$$
P\left(\sum_{i=1}^{1600} Y_i \le 540\right)
$$ using the CLT and compare with an empirical Monte Carlo estimate.

# Exercise 4.4.5: Convergence in Distribution

**Exercise text:**\
Show with pen and paper that if $X_n \sim N(0, 1/n)$, then $X_n \xrightarrow{D} 0$.\
Illustrate this using simulation histograms.

```         
```

# Bonus: Convergence in Probability but not Almost Surely

**Exercise text.**\
Consider independent random variables $(X_n)_{n \ge 1}$ with $$
P(X_n = 1) = \frac{1}{n}, \qquad P(X_n = 0) = 1 - \frac{1}{n}.
$$

1.  Show analytically that $X_n \xrightarrow{P} 0$.\
2.  (Theory) One can prove that with probability 1, $X_n = 1$ occurs infinitely often; hence $X_n$ does **not** converge almost surely to 0.\
3.  Use simulation to:
    -   illustrate convergence in probability (for each fixed $n$, $P(X_n = 1) \approx 1/n$), and

    -   give empirical evidence that 1's keep occurring at large indices, hinting at the lack of almost sure convergence.

## (a) Convergence in probability: empirical P(X_n = 1)

```         
```

## (b) Number of ones per path (up to N_max)

```         
```

## (c) 1's still appear at large indices

```         
```

## (d) Sample paths view (first few paths, first 500 steps)

```         
```

**Interpretation.**\
- You should see from the table in 6(a) that $P(X_n = 1)$ decays like $1/n$, matching convergence in probability to 0.\
- The histogram and tail probabilities in 6(b)–(c) show that each path contains many 1's, and even after large indices $k$, the chance of seeing another 1 is still high.\
- This mirrors the theoretical statement that $X_n = 1$ happens infinitely often with probability 1, so $X_n$ does not converge almost surely to 0.\
- Thus, this example demonstrates concretely that almost sure convergence is strictly stronger than convergence in probability.
